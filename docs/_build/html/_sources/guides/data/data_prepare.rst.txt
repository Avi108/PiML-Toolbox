Data Prepare
======================================

In this section, I will introduce the data preparation module of PiML. In data preparing function, you are allowed
to set the detailed config of the model training procedure, including task configs like target variable, task type, and sample_weight.
And there is the data split setting such as split method, split ratio, and random seed in the data preparing setting to decide how to split data for the experiment.
Besides the setting, you can also get train test data distance results.

Config setting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Target variable: The target variable for training.

Task type: PiML supports two different types of tasks, regression, and classification.

Sample weight: To choose a variable as the sample weight for training.

Split method: PiML supports three different kinds of methods for split training and testing datasets.
   
   - random: Random split.
   - outer-sample: Split samples based on Euclidean distance between each sample to the mean center. Choose the samples farthest away from the center as the test samples.
   - kmeans: Split samples based on kmeans cluster method. After training kmeans cluster, set the test ratio of each cluster and do the random split in each cluster.

Split ratio: To set how much ratio of data as the test data. When using kmeans method, it can be set as a list of ratios of each cluster.

Random Seed: The random seed for the random split.

Train Test Distance 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After setting the config, there is the related train test distance result based on the data split setting.
For overall understanding, we support energy distance.
The energy distance measures the distance between the empirical distribution functions (EDFs) of the two data sets

.. math::
   ED(X,Y) = 2T/n^2 - S/n + (1/n^2) * sum(D(X,X)) + (1/n^2) * sum(D(Y,Y))

where n is the total number of observations in both datasets. The first term represents the contribution of cross-dataset distances, the second term represents the average of within-dataset distances, and the last two terms represent the contributions of within-dataset distances for X and Y, respectively.
To generalize the distance result, before calculating distance, we did the ordinal encoder for categorical features and 0-1 min max scaler transformation.

For example:

   .. jupyter-input::

      exp.data_prepare(target='cnt', task_type='Regression', sample_weight=None,
                       split_method='random', test_ratio=0.2, random_state=0)
